# Roadmap

Here is a rough overview of the kinds of things we are trying to do on the way to the next minor/major Lando version.

Of course we will also always be concurrently working on bug fixes, reasonable improvements and small non-breaking features to the current stable version.

## 3.1 - ETD Early 2021

There are basically three buckets of stuff we want to do here:

### 1. Community

* Bring more of our excellent community into the contribution process
* Start regular contributor meetings that are focused on issue triage, documentation, lando web properties, content, marketing, etc
* Provide a place (eg plugins) for new features, services, recipes, etc to be created and used _outside_ of the main Lando repo
* Provide a set of guides that effectively serves as a _Lando 101_ type course

### 2. Plugins

* Provide `lando` commands for users to easily install, share, scaffold and specify Lando plugins in their apps
* Provide relevant documentation, examples, etc to get people rolling quick
* Create up a few official Lando plugins
* Create 5-10 plugins from other contributors

### 3. Lando Share

* Provide a new `lando share` service
